## Overview

**eldur** is a monospace bitmap font with a 5x13 bounding box (4px avg width,
5px x-height).

## Installation

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/molarmanful/eldur/releases).
Included are bitmap formats - bdf, otb, dfont (Mac) - as well as ttf. 2x
versions are available for HiDPI screens.

For the crispiest viewing experience, try to use the bitmap formats when
possible. If bitmap fonts are not supported (e.g. in VSCode), then use the TTF
at font sizes that are multiples of 13px.

> **Quick Tip**: If you need font size in pt, use the following conversion:
>
> `pt = px - 72 / dpi`
>
> For example: 13px on a 96dpi screen is `13px * 72 / 96dpi = 9.75pt`.
